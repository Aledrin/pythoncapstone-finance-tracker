Dictionaries (with category as key, and tuples as values)
Tuples for storing description and amount
Loops (while, for) for continuous input and iteration
Exception Handling (try, except) for invalid inputs
Input validation (e.g., rejecting numeric-only descriptions/categories)
Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
User interaction through input() and formatted print() statements
